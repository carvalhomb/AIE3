    "\n",
    "Here's some passages from their [blog](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) about the `text-embedding-3` release:\n",

    "> `text-embedding-3-small` is our new highly efficient embedding model and provides a significant upgrade over its predecessor, the `text-embedding-ada-002` model...\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Stronger performance.** Comparing `text-embedding-ada-002` to `text-embedding-3-small`, the average score on a commonly used benchmark for multi-language retrieval ([MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl)) has increased from 31.4% to 44.0%, while the average score on a commonly used benchmark for English tasks ([MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb)) has increased from 61.0% to 62.3%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, with a library like Ragas - we can put that claim to the test!\n",
    "\n",
    "If what they claim is true - we should see an increase on related metrics by using the new embedding model!"

    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Qdrant, along with other vector databases, are made for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors efficiently, using specialized data structures and indexes. These databases enable fast similarity and semantic search while allowing users to find vectors that are the closest to a given query vector based on some distance metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Qdrant, specifically, uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), which is used to implement Approximate Nearest Neighbors. HNSW is a graph-based indexing algorithm, which builds a multi-layer navigation structure according to certain rules. The upper layers are more sparse and the distances between nodes are farther. The lower layers are denser and the distances between nodes are closer. The search starts from the uppermost layer, finds the node closest to the target in this layer, and then enters the next layer to begin another search. This is repeated until the target is approached.\n",
    "- Compression techniques such as Product Quantization, Scalar Quantization and Binary Quantization, which enable efficient storage and search of high-dimensional vectors by transforming the original vectors into new representations with less precision with minimal loss in precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Qdrant has a few other features that make it a good choice for a Vector database, such as:\n",
    "- Multi-Vector Support: Qdrant allows the integration of multiple vectors per document. This enables more nuanced and relevant search results by combining different aspects of the data, such as the title and body of a document.\n",
    "- Option to store vectors in memory or on-disk, allowin gthe user to decide on the trade-off of speed vs storage capacity\n",
    "- Distributed deployment, to distribute the data across the peers to extend the storage capabilities and increase stability.\n",

    "In short, the pipeline takes the question asked by the user and runs it through the vector store retrieval process to get the top-n most similar documents to the question as the context. Both the question and the context (as a dictionary) are passed forward to the prompt template, which formats the prompt, and then forwarded to the primary QA LLM (in this case gpt-3.5-turbo), so that it returns a response. The context is also provided in the final dictionary, unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "A step-by-step description of the pipeline is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline starts with creating a dictionary with two keys, \"context\" and \"question\". The question is simply the same string informed by the user, which is forwarded to the chain via the `invoke` method. The \"context\" key, on the other hand, is created by passing the original question through the \"retriever\" function, which has been previously defined as a Qdrand vector store retriever. This will search in the vector store for the most similar documents to the question and assign it to the \"context\" key. These steps happen in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the RunnablePassthrough step allows the question to be passed forward unchanged, and the context gets assigned to the dictionary as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, both keys (context and question) are passed to the promt template for proper formatting and then to the LLM, which will generate the response. The result will be a dictionary with the response from the LLM and the retrieved context.\n",

This is because, as mentioned in the Ragas documentation, \"LLMs by default are not good at creating diverse samples as it tends to follow common paths\". If our evaluation questions are exactly the same as the documents in the RAG pipeline, we will end up not being able to create diverse and hard enough questions that will test the RAG pipeline in conditions that would be most similar to a production environment. It will be something akin to overfitting, as our evaluation will only show us how well the RAG pipeline works with questions extracted from the exact same environment in which the RAG was trained, and consequently it will not give us a very useful evaluation of how the model would perform in real tasks in the real world.\n",

      "Q: What strategies can undergrads use to gain real-world experience before finishing their degree and excel in their field?\n",

      "A: Undergrads can gain real-world experience by working during the school year, being a staff member at a campus computer lab or research lab, pursuing internship and co-op programs, and targeting the best companies in their field for opportunities. It is also recommended to be patient, stay informed about what's going on in the industry, and take a job that will teach practical skills. Additionally, pursuing undergraduate degrees with a technical element that teach substantive skills can be beneficial for excelling in the real world.\n",

      "\n",
      "TRUTH: There are many aspects to hiring great people, and various people smarter than me have written extensively on the topic. So I’m not going to try to be comprehensive. But I am going to relay some lessons learned through hard experience on how to hire the best people you’ve ever worked with — particularly for a startup.\n",

      "\n",
      "A: It is important to give an executive full latitude in running an organization because they have the ability to make decisions, organize, and execute within their function better than a manager. Executives have a higher degree of latitude to implement their own theories and principles, which can contribute to the success of the company. This freedom allows them to build and run the organization effectively, potentially leading to personal financial independence and overall company success.\n",

      "TRUTH: It is important to give an executive full latitude in running an organization because it allows them to effectively manage and make decisions without constant interference or micromanagement. This empowers the executive to take ownership of their role and responsibilities, leading to better results and overall success for the organization.\n",
