    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

    "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent Response: RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique used in the context of large language models (LLMs) to improve their performance by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. The core idea behind RAG is to enhance the generative capabilities of language models by incorporating relevant information retrieved from a large corpus of documents or a knowledge base.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components of RAG:\n",
      "1. **Retriever**: This component is responsible for fetching relevant documents or passages from a large corpus based on the input query.\n",
      "2. **Generator**: This component generates the final response by conditioning on both the input query and the retrieved documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How RAG Works:\n",
      "1. **Query Input**: The user provides a query or prompt.\n",
      "2. **Document Retrieval**: The retriever searches a large corpus to find documents or passages that are relevant to the query.\n",
      "3. **Response Generation**: The generator uses the retrieved documents along with the original query to generate a coherent and contextually accurate response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advantages of RAG:\n",
      "- **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging external knowledge, RAG can provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n",
      "- **Scalability**: It can handle a vast amount of information by retrieving only the most relevant pieces, making it scalable for large datasets.\n",
      "- **Flexibility**: It can be adapted to various domains by changing the underlying corpus used for retrieval.\n",

      "### When Did RAG Break Onto the Scene?\n",
      "RAG was introduced by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in a paper titled \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks,\" which was published in 2020. The paper demonstrated that RAG could significantly improve the performance of language models on various knowledge-intensive tasks, such as open-domain question answering and fact-checking.\n",

       "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This can involve concatenating the retrieved information with the original query or using it to provide additional context.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model (e.g., GPT-3, BERT), is used to generate a response based on the augmented input. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses by leveraging the additional information provided by the retrieval step.\\n\\nRAG models are particularly useful in scenarios where the information needed to answer a query is not contained within the model's parameters but can be found in external documents. This approach allows the model to access a broader knowledge base and generate more informed and accurate responses.\""

A simple improvement would be to convert everything to lower case before comparing; another improvement could be to generate alternate spellings of the required answer and consider them, too. One possible way could be to do a comparison by embeddings, although I'm not sure if this would then be too relaxed with the must-mention requirement. Finally, an LLM-based evaluator that judges whether the must-mention terms are in the answer would potentially be even more able to catch right answers that don't exactly match the term.\n"

Here are some significant improvements that the LoRA system makes:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for fine-tuning. Instead of updating all the parameters of a large model, LoRA introduces low-rank matrices that adapt the pre-trained weights, making the process more efficient.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process becomes faster. This allows for quicker iterations and experimentation, which is valuable in research and development settings.\\n\\n4. **Better Generalization**: LoRA can help in achieving better generalization on downstream tasks. By focusing on low-rank adaptations, the model can avoid overfitting to the fine-tuning data, leading to improved performance on unseen data.\\n\\n5. **Scalability**: LoRA makes it feasible to fine-tune very large models that would be impractical to update fully. This scalability is crucial as models continue to grow in size and complexity.\\n\\n6. **Modularity**: The low-rank matrices introduced by LoRA can be seen as modular components that can be easily added or removed. This modularity allows for more flexible experimentation and adaptation of models to different tasks.\\n\\n7. **Cost-Effectiveness**: By reducing the computational and memory requirements, LoRA makes the fine-tuning process more cost-effective. This is particularly important for organizations with limited resources.\\n\\nOverall, LoRA provides a more efficient and scalable approach to fine-tuning large pre-trained models, making it a valuable technique in the field of machine learning.',\n",

Instead of updating all the parameters of a model during fine-tuning, LoRA introduces a small number of additional trainable parameters that are low-rank matrices.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent Response: Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-trained model is further trained on a new dataset to adapt it to a specific task. This approach leverages the knowledge the model has already acquired during its initial training on a large, general dataset, allowing it to perform well on a new, often smaller, and more specific dataset with relatively less training time and computational resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Steps in Fine-Tuning:\n",
      "1. **Pre-training**: A model is trained on a large, general dataset. For example, a language model might be trained on a vast corpus of text from the internet.\n",
      "2. **Fine-tuning**: The pre-trained model is then trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This step adjusts the model's parameters to better suit the specific task at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Benefits of Fine-Tuning:\n",
      "- **Efficiency**: Reduces the amount of data and computational resources needed compared to training a model from scratch.\n",
      "- **Performance**: Often leads to better performance on specific tasks because the model starts with a strong foundation of general knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Historical Context:\n",
