        "**1:** OpenAI's API documentation says that yes, we can pass a parameter with the number of dimensions to use to models `text-embedding-3` and later models, which includes `text-embedding-3-small`, and shorten the number of dimensions without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties. This has some cost in accuracy, but it might be useful in certain use cases. It is also possible to shorten the dimensions manually after getting the embeddings from OpenAI, but in that case the dimensions need to be normalized.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the wrapper function we are using above `get_embedding` does not accept this parameter to pass it forward to the OpenAI Python Library, so if I wanted to change the number of dimensions here in this notebook, I'd need to make the call myself, or, as mentioned above, I'd need to shorten them myself then normalize them manually.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea is this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
        "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
        "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."
